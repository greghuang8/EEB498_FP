File names and contents/purpose


CSV files
Fortin_TWC_LU_2016: 
All relevant data stored in this file. This includes lat-long location, host and parasite information, date, and zoning. 

ID_PopDen:
Shows the calculated population density (pdSTD) for each of the location IDs

pd_included: 
Somewhat similar to ID_PopDen, but one thing to note is that htis csv file also contains zoning information which is used for the main analysis.

TWC_PopDen_GME_March2015:
Includes population density data for all locations

R scripts
pop_density:
A short script determining the bin sizes of the population density heat map. The bins become the guide to dividing up the data into zones.

watts_bipart_script: 
Script initially developed for Dr. Watt's PhD thesis; here I make couple changes to accomodate the updated zones.


PDF files
Project_Proposal_Greg_498: Pretty self explanatory.
